# boilerplate 

## already in this boilerplate
- react with typescript template
- zustand configuration using firebase call, middlewares, selectors, slice, and combine store using 2 slices (filter & todos), devtools config with no-anonyme action in devtools
- firebase (pre config, with empty config files)
- tailwind, styled-component & tailwind-styled-component install & configure
- install & configure esLint using eslintrc.json for my own specificity.

## soon 
- basic structure with some text using Jest, to test zustand store

## recap
- small start of an app allowing to start a project with this stack on a good track 
- once firebase is connected, uncomment all the indicated code and delete what needs to be deleted 
- in the meantime the app works very well without firebase and allows you to discover zustand and some logic
